## 🧠 Difficulty
**Easy**

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears **twice** except for one.  
Find that single one.

> You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and use **only constant extra space**.

---

## 📥 Input

- An integer array `nums[]` with all elements appearing exactly twice except one.

## 📤 Output

- Return the **single element** that appears only once.

---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element appears exactly twice except for one.
